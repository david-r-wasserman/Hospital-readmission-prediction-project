# Hospital readmission prediction for diabetes patients
By Dr. David Wasserman

## Analysis goal:
Given the data from a hospital visit, predict whether or not the patient will be readmitted within 30 days. I will train a classifier on a subset of the dataset, and test it on an unseen portion of the dataset. 

**Note**: medical practice has changed since 2008, so the resulting model should not be expected to work well with current data. It is intended to shows the skills I would use if I was working with current data.
